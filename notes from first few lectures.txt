To install python and do some stuff to get things setup:

Which ide/notepad software should I use? Why
	Jupiter notebooks will be useed for the udemy course.
	There are a few options for IDEs, but until I get around to doing that I can just use Notepad++ and compile via the console.

I need to install Python.

For that other youtube video series I was checking out, there some package I need as well.

Now I've made another change
